    Now, Sofia’s mom is the queen of Enchancia and Sofia is the princess. 
    The trouble is, Sofia doesn’t really know anything about being a princess. She never had to do a royal wave, she is not sure when to curtsy, or even which fork to use at dinner! “I’ll never be as perfect a princess as my new step-sister Amber,” Sofia says.
  “Just be yourself and you’ll be fine!” her mom says. Sofia is not sure that will work. “How can I be myself and be a princess at the same time?” she asks. King Roland, her new dad, tries to help. He gives Sofia a beautiful necklace called 
    the Amulet of Avator. Her dad says, “It’s a welcome to the family gift and that lots of princesses before her have worn it!” Then he tells they’re having a royal ball in her honor.They have to dance the first waltz together. 
  That’s another thing she doesn’t know how to do the dance.

  When Sofia gets to the ballroom, she says the magic words and everyone wake up. Then the king and Sofia begin to waltz. Sofia looks over at Amber and smiles. “I can’t believe how happy I’m! 
  I think I’m going to fit into this royal family after all!” Sofia says to herself.
 “Sofia, I’m so proud of you! You dance wonderfully!” her dad says. “Thank you, Your Majesty, I mean dad!” Sofia says. “You know Sofia, being a princess is about having a good heart, and you are going to make a great princess,” says her dad. “Dad, I’ve been 
    wondering, why do they call you King Roland the Second? she asks. “Because my father also named Roland,” he tells her.
